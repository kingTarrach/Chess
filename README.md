# Chess Game Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Chess Game repository! This project represents a full implementation of the classic game of chess, featuring a visually appealing board, game logic, and AI functionality for single-player games. This repository showcases my journey in mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), implementing complex algorithms, and refining project management skills through end-to-end software development.

## Key Learnings
### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Designed modular and reusable code using classes such as Board, Piece, and Game.
Leveraged principles like inheritance and encapsulation to simplify the representation of chess pieces and their behaviors.

### 2. Complex Algorithms
Implemented move validation, check/checkmate detection, and castling logic.
Developed efficient algorithms to handle AI decision-making using a basic minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

### 3. Project Management
Organized tasks with clear milestones, ensuring steady progress from planning to completion.
Utilized version control for collaboration and version history, and conducted regular code reviews.

## Features
Full chess functionality: Supports all standard chess rules (including en passant, promotion, and castling).
Single-player AI: Basic AI opponent to play against.
Two-player mode: Play locally with a friend.
Interactive GUI: A visually rich chessboard built with Pygame.

## How to Use
### 1. Prerequisites
1. Install Python (version 3.8 or newer is recommended).
2. Install Pygame.
To install Pygame, use the following command: pip install pygame

### 2. Running the game
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/kingTarrach/chess.git

cd chess

### 3. Run the game script:
python3 main.py

#### Enjoy playing chess!
